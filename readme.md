# Requirements and Scenarios for Digital Twin of Crash Avoidance Software

## Requirements

1. **Emergency Braking:**
   - Detect obstacles and initiate emergency braking.
   - Measure braking distance and stopping time.

2. **Evasive Maneuvers:**
   - Detect potential collisions and perform evasive maneuvers.
   - Measure the success rate of collision avoidance.

3. **External Scenarios:**
   - Weather conditions: rain, snow, fog, clear.
   - Road types: highway, urban, rural.
   - Traffic situations: heavy traffic, light traffic, pedestrian crossings.

## Scenarios

   - Vehicle detects an obstacle in rainy conditions.
   - Initiates emergency braking and measures stopping distance.

2. **Scenario 2: Evasive Maneuver on Highway**
   - Vehicle detects a sudden obstacle on the highway.
   - Performs an evasive maneuver to avoid collision.

3. **Scenario 3: Pedestrian Crossing in Urban Area**
   - Vehicle detects a pedestrian crossing the road in an urban area.
   - Initiates emergency braking or evasive maneuver to avoid collision.

4. **Scenario 4: Emergency Braking in Heavy Traffic**
   - Vehicle detects a sudden stop in heavy traffic.
   - Initiates emergency braking and measures stopping distance.
